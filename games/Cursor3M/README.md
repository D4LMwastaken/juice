# Cursor3M

**Team Members:** Julian (D4LM), Someone else maybe

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like MotX3M meets a game with cursor but with no language and accuracy and where there is physics...

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
* Mouse acceleleration: If the cursor is at the same distance as the player(block) is moving toward, the player speeds up
* Friction: If the player is on the cursor, they will keep on moving forwards in the same direction if going faster than a certain speed


**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
* Players have to navigate a series of obstacles using only the gameplay mechanics in a certain amount of time
* Challenges: Walls (curved, straight, etc)
* Rewards: New avatars (passing certain stages with certain stars or getting a specific total amount of stars)
**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
* Fun, cool ui, just general addiction
